About this template
===================

* Structure your report using numbers and titles following those of the assignment.

* For every task include all images you generated in a format that is viewable within a web browser. You can use HDRI Tools, or photoshop to tonemap you images and save them as jpgs or pngs. We recommend tonemapping your images by just changing exposure and using sRGB (if available) or a gamma of 2.2.

* Include descriptions of encountered problems, a list of external libraries that you used (if applicable) and the time you spent on each task.

LaTeX is also supported:
$$
L_o(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o) = \int_{\Omega} L_i(\mathbf{x},\omega_i)\, f(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \omega_o)\, |\cos\theta_i|\, \mathrm{d}\omega_i
$$
